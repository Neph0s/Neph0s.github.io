However, simulating established characters presents a challenging task for RPLAs, due to the lack of authentic character datasets and nuanced evaluation methods using such data. In this paper, we present CoSER, a collection of a high-quality dataset, open models, and an evaluation protocol towards effective RPLAs of established characters. The CoSER dataset covers 17,966 characters from 771 renowned books. It provides authentic dialogues with real-world intricacies, as well as diverse data types such as conversation setups, character experiences and internal thoughts. Drawing from acting methodology, we introduce given-circumstance acting for training and evaluating role-playing LLMs, where LLMs sequentially portray multiple characters in book scenes. Using our dataset, we develop CoSER 8B and CoSER 70B, i.e., advanced open role-playing LLMs built on LLaMA-3.1 models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the value of the CoSER dataset for RPLA training, evaluation and retrieval. Moreover, CoSER 70B exhibits state-of-the-art performance surpassing or matching GPT-4o on our evaluation and three existing benchmarks, i.e., achieving 75.80% and 93.47% accuracy on the InCharacter and LifeChoice benchmarks respectively.","tags":[],"title":"CoSER: Coordinating LLM-Based Persona Simulation of Established Roles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiangjie Chen","Xintao Wang","Rui Xu","Siyu Yuan","Yikai Zhang","Wei Shi","Jian Xie","Shuang Li","Ruihan Yang","Tinghui Zhu","Aili Chen","Nianqi Li","Lida Chen","Caiyu Hu","Siye Wu","Scott Ren","Ziquan Fu","Yanghua Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Recent research has unveiled the potential of LLMs to role-play assigned personas, mimicking their knowledge and linguistic habits. However, imitative decision-making requires a more nuanced understanding of personas. In this paper, we benchmark the ability of LLMs in persona-driven decision-making. Specifically, we investigate whether LLMs can predict characters' decisions provided with the preceding stories in high-quality novels. Leveraging character analyses written by literary experts, we construct a dataset LIFECHOICE comprising 1,401 character decision points from 395 books. Then, we conduct comprehensive experiments on LIFECHOICE, with various LLMs and methods for LLM role-playing. The results demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit promising capabilities in this task, yet there is substantial room for improvement. Hence, we further propose the CHARMAP method, which achieves a 6.01% increase in accuracy via persona-based memory retrieval. We will make our datasets and code publicly available.","tags":[],"title":"Character is Destiny: Can Large Language Models Simulate Persona-Driven Decisions in Role-Playing?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xinfeng Yuan","Siyu Yuan","Yuhan Cui","Tianhe Lin","Xintao Wang","Rui Xu","Jiangjie Chen","Deqing Yang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The prerequisite for these RPAs lies in the capability of LLMs to understand characters from fictional works. Previous efforts have evaluated this capability via basic classification tasks or characteristic imitation, failing to capture the nuanced character understanding with LLMs. In this paper, we propose evaluating LLMs' character understanding capability via the character profiling task, i.e., summarizing character profiles from corresponding materials, a widely adopted yet understudied practice for RPA development. Specifically, we construct the CroSS dataset from literature experts and assess the generated profiles by comparing ground truth references and their applicability in downstream tasks. Our experiments, which cover various summarization methods and LLMs, have yielded promising results. These results strongly validate the character understanding capability of LLMs. We believe our constructed resource will promote further research in this field.

While recent efforts have focuses on connecting LLMs with external knowledge sources, the integration of knowledge bases (KBs) remains understudied and faces several challenges. In this paper, we introduce KnowledGPT, a comprehensive framework to bridge LLMs with various knowledge bases, facilitating both the retrieval and storage of knowledge. The retrieval process employs the program of thought prompting, which generates search language for KBs in code format with pre-defined functions for KB operations. Besides retrieval, KnowledGPT offers the capability to store knowledge in a personalized KB, catering to individual user demands. With extensive experiments, we show that by integrating LLMs with KBs, KnowledGPT properly answers a broader range of questions requiring world knowledge compared with vanilla LLMs, utilizing both knowledge existing in widely-known KBs and extracted into personalized KBs.","tags":[],"title":"Knowledgpt: Enhancing large language models with retrieval and storage access on knowledge bases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qianyu He","Xintao Wang","Jiaqing Liang","Yanghua Xiao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, there is still a considerable gap between machine intelligence and human cognition in similes, since deep models based on statistical distribution tend to favour high-frequency similes. Hence, a large-scale symbolic knowledge base of similes is required, as it contributes to the modeling of diverse yet unpopular similes while facilitating additional evaluation and reasoning. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel framework for large-scale simile knowledge base construction, as well as two probabilistic metrics which enable an improved understanding of simile phenomena in natural language. Overall, we construct MAPS-KB, a million-scale probabilistic simile knowledge base, covering 4.3 million triplets over 0.4 million terms from 70 GB corpora. We conduct sufficient experiments to justify the effectiveness and necessity of the methods of our framework.

You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$\rExample inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\rf(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\r1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}\r$$\rDiagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.
